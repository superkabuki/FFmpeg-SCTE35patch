# SuperKabuki SCTE35 patch for FFmpeg
### FFmpeg changes mpegts SCTE-35 Streams (__0x86__) into bin data Streams (__0x06__).  
### This is a patch for FFmpeg to let SCTE-35 mpegts Streams copy over as SCTE-35 Streams.
---

## How does it work?

* The patch is only nine lines of code, it allows you copy a SCTE-35 stream over as SCTE-35, when you're encoding with ffmpeg.
* The patch also adds the SCTE-35 Descriptor __(CUEI / 0x49455543)__ , just to be fancy.
* Everything else works just like unpatched ffmpeg.
---

## How to use:

### These are all super important. 

* map the SCTE-35 stream to the output file like  `-map 0` or maybe `-map 0:d` etc..
* Set the SCTE-35 stream to copy like `-dcodec copy` or `-c copy` etc..
* Use `-copyts` if you want your SCTE-35 and PTS to stay aligned 
* Use `-muxpreload 0` and  `-muxdelay 0` to avoid the 1.4 second start bump

> Notice the start time and duration have both changed by ~200 seconds.
