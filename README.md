# SuperKabuki SCTE35 patch for FFmpeg

 FFmpeg changes mpegts SCTE-35 Streams (__0x86__) into bin data Streams (__0x06__).  
<br> This is a patch for FFmpeg to let SCTE-35 mpegts Streams copy over as SCTE-35 Streams.

# FFmpeg with the SuperKabuki SCTE-35 patch applied.


 To make sure we are all on the same page, [This repo](https://github.com/superkabuki/FFmpeg_SCTE35) has the ffmpeg source with the patch applied.
 
## ...why?
If you work with SCTE-35 and you use ffmpeg,<br> having the SCTE-35 stream type 0x86 changed to bin data 0x06, makes your life hard.

<br>


## What does it do?

* The patch  allows you copy a SCTE-35 stream over as SCTE-35, when you're encoding with ffmpeg.
* The patch also adds the SCTE-35 Descriptor __(CUEI / 0x49455543)__ , just to be fancy.
* Everything else works just like unpatched ffmpeg.

# Examples

1.  Re-encode video to h.265, audio to aac, copy over the SCTE-35, and keep the timestamps.


```smalltalk
ffmpeg -copyts -i input.ts -map 0  -c:v h265 -c:a aac -c:d copy -muxpreload 0 -muxdelay 0 output.ts
```

2. Copy all streams including SCTE-35, cut the first 200 seconds, and keep the timestamps.

```smalltalk
ffmpeg -copyts -ss 200 -i input.ts -map 0  -c copy -muxpreload 0 -muxdelay 0 output.ts
```
